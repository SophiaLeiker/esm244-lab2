## Objectives

- Practice comparing the performance of different linear regression models using AIC and cross-validation
- Learn to use formulas in R models
- Use a for-loop to perform cross-validation manually

## What did we learn
- AIC()
- folds
- training and test sets
- creating function for RMSE
- using training models to predict on test set
- averaging out the folds
